instrutil.h and instrutil.c:
   contains helper functions for code generation

parse.y:
  contains incomplete and wrong syntax rules; meant to illustrate
  the use of the helper functions in instrutil.h/c 


You should extend your front-end from project 2 to write the code
generator for project 3.

testcases/demo*
  contains basic test cases; this set is not meant to be complete, but
  should give you a good starting point. 

iloc.out
	When you run "codegen < testcases/demo1", the generated iloc code should be in
"iloc.out"
